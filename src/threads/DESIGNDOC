    		     PROD/CONS
	  		     =========

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B1: How does your solution guarantee that consumers will hold until
>> there is something to consume in the buffer?

It is guaranteed that consumers will hold until there is something to
consume since they will first check whether the buffer is empty. If it is
actually empty, they will suspend the thread execution until `buffer_not_emtpy'
is signaled to them. And only then they continue with consuming a character.
And since the check whether the buffer is empty is guarded the aquisition
of a lock, it is ensured that only one consumer at a time performs this check.

>> B2: How does your solution guarantee that producers will hold until
>> there is some free space in the buffer?

It is guaranteed that producers will hold until there is free space in the
buffer since for each character they want to produce, they will first check
whether the buffer is not full. If it is full, the suspend the thread
execution until `buffer_not_full' is signaled to them, and only then they
continue producing that character.
And since the check whether the buffer is already full is guarded by the
aquisition of a lock, it is ensured that only one producer at a time performs
this check.

>> B3: How does your solution preserve a FIFO semantics i.e., the first
>> character produced will be the first to be consumed?

The buffer is implemented as a circular buffer with constant length N.
It has a current reading index and a current writing index. Each read
or write targets the character with the according index in the buffer, and
afterwards the accroding index will be increased. If the index then overflows
the size of the buffer, it will be reset to the front of the buffer.
Therefore, if the reading index and writing index are the same, the buffer
is either empty or full, thus we need to store the amount of currently stored
items as well.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B4: Give an intuition for why your program preserves safety.

The program is preserving safety since every access to both buffer and output
are guard behind a lock. Thus, no data races should occur.

>> B5: Why did you choose this design? Did you consider other design
>> alternatives? In what ways is it superior to another design you considered?

we chose this design since it does not lead to too much complexity in the
program logic, and thus shoudl be safer.


			     NARROW BRIDGE
			     =============

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C1: How does your solution guarantee that no more that 3 vehicles
>> are crossing the bridge in the same direction?

>> C2: What prevents vehicles from opposite directions from crossing the
>> bridge simultaneously?

>> C3: How does your solution grant priority to emergency vehicles over
>> the queue of vehicles ahead in the same direction?

>> C4: How do you guarantee that despite having priority, emergency vehicles
>> do not start crossing the bridge while there are still vehicles crossing
>> it in the oposite direction?

>> C5: Explain with examples why your solution does not preserve neither
>> fairness nor freedom from starvation, other than what has been indicated
>> for emergency vehicles.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future semesters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
