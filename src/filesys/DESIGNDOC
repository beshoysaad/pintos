		     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES
		     ============================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct inode_disk_indirect
{
  block_sector_t sector_nums[NUM_INDIRECT_SECTORS];
};
This is a block sector containing 128 addresses of indirect block sectors.
This is used when allocating indirect and doubly-indirect nodes.

struct inode_disk
{
  off_t length; /* File size in bytes. */
  block_sector_t sector_nums[NUM_DIRECT_SECTORS]; /* Direct pointers. */
  block_sector_t indirect; /* Singly-indirect pointer. */
  block_sector_t doubly_indirect; /* Doubly-indirect pointer. */
  unsigned magic; /* Magic number. */
};
The on-disk inode now contains 124 direct sector numbers, in addition to one
singly-indirect block that points to 128 data blocks, and one doubly-indirect 
block that points to 128 singly-indirect blocks.

>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

maximum file size = 124 direct nodes * 512 + 128 singly-indirect nodes * 512
+ 128 * 128 doubly-indirect nodes * 512 = 8517632 bytes ~ 8.123 MB

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.

We have kept the global file system lock from previous projects, thus no two
processes can access the file system at once.

>> A4: Suppose processes A and B both have file F open, both
>> positioned at end-of-file.  If A reads and B writes F at the same
>> time, A may read all, part, or none of what B writes.  However, A
>> may not read data other than what B writes, e.g. if B writes
>> nonzero data, A is not allowed to see all zeros.  Explain how your
>> code avoids this race.

Again, the global lock prevents this scenario. A will either read before B 
writes (thus it reads no new data) or after (so it reads all new data).

>> A5: Explain how your synchronization design provides "fairness".
>> File access is "fair" if readers cannot indefinitely block writers
>> or vice versa.  That is, many processes reading from a file cannot

Our current design does not provide fairness.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Is your inode structure a multilevel index?  If so, why did you
>> choose this particular combination of direct, indirect, and doubly
>> indirect blocks?  If not, why did you choose an alternative inode
>> structure, and what advantages and disadvantages does your
>> structure have, compared to a multilevel index?

Our inode structure is multi-level indexed (with max depth of 2). We have 
chosen to implement only 1 indirect and 1 doubly-indirect block since this 
covers the target maximum size of 8 MB.

			    SUBDIRECTORIES
			    ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

/* A single directory entry. */
struct dir_entry
{
  block_sector_t inode_sector; /* Sector number of header. */
  char name[NAME_MAX + 1]; /* Null terminated file name. */
  bool in_use; /* In use or free? */
  enum entry_type type; /* Is this a file or a directory */
};
directory entry now has a new member to indicate whether the entry is a file 
or a subdirectory.

struct process
{
  ...
  struct dir *cur_dir;
};
process struct now has a directory pointer to indicate current directory

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

We traverse absolute paths starting from root, while we traverse relative paths 
starting from the current directory of the process.
We use strtok_r to tokenize the given string and lookup the returned token each
time. If the token doesn't exist in the current directory we return false. 
Otherwise if we finish the traversal we do the required operation (add, remove, etc)

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.

The global filesystem lock prevents races.

>> B5: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it
>> is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current
>> working directory?  If so, what happens to that process's future
>> file system operations?  If not, how do you prevent it?

We allow the removal of an open directory as well as a working directory.
It is marked as removed and all further operations on that directory fail.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
>> process the way you did.


			     BUFFER CACHE
			     ============

>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.

>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> that block?

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
