# Operating Systems Project - Winter Semester 2019
The project was to implement a simple operating system (based on the Pintos system from Stanford University). The project had four stages:
1. Threads and synchronization.
2. User programs.
3. Virtual memory.
4. Filing services.

Each stage built on services that were implemented in previous stages of the project.
To make it possible to complete the project in one semester, some code was provided that implements a subset of the required functionality. Major extensions were made to the existing design and implementation, adding missing functionality and improving performance. In stages 2, 3, and 4, design choices were also evaluated experimentally.
The software produced was graded based on its ability to successfully pass a set of functional and performance tests.
